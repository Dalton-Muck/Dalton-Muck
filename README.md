## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAbout me

üéìMy name is Dalton Muck, I am a **Software Developer**(specializing in **Angular applications**) with a focus on creating safe user-friendly web applications. I am also pursuing my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** and plan on graduating in early **2026**.

üíªI enjoy working at my part-time internship during the school year. In this past year, I have worked with a team to meet weekly deadlines to enhance and modify existing campus software programs like the Information Technologies home page. I aim to get at least 2 more internships before getting my undergraduate degree in either Software Development, or Data analytics where I can focus on Cyber Security. 

ü•èOutside of my studies I have enjoyed working as a licensed softball and basketball official which is where I have been working for 5 years to help avoid student loans. When I am not completing coursework or working I enjoy time with my friends on the club ultimate frisbee team. I also enjoy kayaking, running, and hiking.
